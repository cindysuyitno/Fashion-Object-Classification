# Data Science Project: Fashion Object Classification
This project aims to assist users of fashion e-commerce when they want to upload their products. From over 300 pictures of each category downloaded from google (which then splitted 80:20 to train and test data), the classifier would predict the fashion object class by the picture uploaded by the user. 

# Technologies used
Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit), Google Colab

# Conclusion and Suggestions from the Author 
This project enables a simple Sequential model that has been successfully trained to predict 5 fashion object classifications: T-shirt, bag, dress, shoes, and trousers, with training accuracy up to 0.85 and validation accuracy up to 0.75 after training. There is room for improvement, however, in the future as more data and more fashion object category applied to the model.
